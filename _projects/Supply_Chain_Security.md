Research questions:
- Weaklink Signals. What type of weak link signals exists in a package supply chain that may expose a package to a higher risk of a supply chain attack?
- Best Security Practices. What trends across open source ecosystems are observed in project security and criticality? 
- Relation. What relationships exist between the security practices adaption and security outcomes?
- Outcome. Does the knowledge of security practices and weak link signals improve the entire ecosystem's security?
