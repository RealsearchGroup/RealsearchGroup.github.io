title: Risk-based Secret Detection
subtitle: Aid practitioners to identify checked-in credentials and mitigate secrets leakage
status: active

description: The goal of this project is to aid software practitioners in reducing the security risk of checked-in secrets through the development of empirically-based tools for identifying and prioritizing the eradication of already checked-in secrets and techniques for securely managing secrets to prevent injection of secrets into a codebase.

Research Contributions:

- Understanding of the developer motivation and decision making related to checking in secrets.

- SecretBench, a benchmark of secret-containing files that can be used to compare secret detection tools.

- Improved static analysis tools for detecting checked-in secrets.

- A risk-based tool for prioritizing the eradication of already checked-in secrets.
